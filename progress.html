        <h2>Frederick Sanger</h2>
        <p>Scientists had been keenly interested in proteins since the late nineteenth century, seeing them as molecules essential to virtually every biological process in the body. 
          Working out the composition of proteins was thus seen as key to understanding how proteins functioned and the basis for their synthetic production.</p>
        <p>In 1955 English biochemist Frederick Sanger sequenced the amino acids of insulin, the first of any protein. </p>
        <p>Sanger's work “revealed that a protein has a definite constant, genetically determined sequence—and yet a sequence with no general rule for its assembly. 
          Therefore it had to have a code” (Judson, Eighth Day of Creation, 188).</p>

        <h2>MIT</h2>
        <p>For decades, a community of scientist have been working on a way to figure out a protein's shape. Using its string of amino acids.</p>
        <p>A major challenge in our understanding of biology.</p>
        <p>Their tabletop automated flow synthesis machine can string together hundreds of amino acids, the building blocks of proteins, within hours. 
          The researchers believe their new technology could speed up the manufacturing of on-demand therapies and the development of new drugs,
          and allow scientists to design artificial proteins by incorporating amino acids that don't exist in cells.</p>

        <h2>AlphaFold</h2>
        <p>New insights and breakthroughs in artificial intelligence are forcing proteins to give up their secrets. Scientists are now forging biochemical tools that could transform
           our world.</p>
        <p>AlphaFold is an AI system that was created to solve this problem. AlphaFold is trained on sequences and structure of proteins mapped out by scientists from around the world.</p>
      <p> Before AlphaFold, about 17% of the 20,000 proteins in the human body had an experimentally determined structure, but now the world has access to around 98% of the human proteome.
        AlphaFold predicted over 50% of those structures with high or very high accuracy which is ages ahead of where research once was.
        </p>
        <p>Today, it can accurately predict a protein shape just from its sequence of amino acids. 
          It can enable progress in all sorts of areas.</p>
